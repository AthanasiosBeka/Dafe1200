    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <img src="images/team2.jpg", class="team">
    <p>Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better.
      It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.</p>

<p>Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market.
From just a narrow storefront, Caffee offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees.
The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</p>

<p>In 1981, Howard Schultz (Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer) had first walked into a Caffee store.
From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Starbucks and joined a year later.</p>

<p>In 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience.
He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community.
A third place between work and home. He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase Caffee with the help of local investors.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Caffee set out to be a different kind of company.
One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.</p>
