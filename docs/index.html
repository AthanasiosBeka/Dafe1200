    <p>Guess what?
      We’ve just opened our coffee shop!
      We love to travel & work remotely in different coffee shops around the world.
      That inspired us to open our place for people to work & enjoy good coffee.
      Coffee shop is located in MailerLite office. If you ever come to Oslo, please visit us.
      We guarantee good coffee & fast Wi-fi & great atmosphere. And it’s all FREE!</p>
      <p>Our mission since we roasted our first batch of coffee in 1991 has been to give you the BEST cup of coffee you have ever had.
      We roast on demand to make sure that you receive the freshest coffee possible! thank you for your support! We are so excited to begin our re-expansion!
      Look out Charleston and beyond! we are going to change your coffee experience!
      Who doesn't love a nice warm cup of coffee? We sure do. But, local cafes seem to be popping up everywhere, especially in the larger cities.</p>
      <p>Steve is a college graduate, espresso fanatic, and book lover. He wants to open up a coffee shop that caters to people just like him. He decides to call it Book and Beans.
      New customers stop in, order a drink of their choice, and then can browse Steve's wonderful library of self help books and historical non fiction.
      (There just happen to be his two favorite genres.) Business is actually amazing, and Steve can't complain.</p>
