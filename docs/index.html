      We’ve just opened our coffee shop!
      We love to travel & work remotely in different coffee shops around the world.

      We guarantee good coffee & fast Wi-fi & great atmosphere. And it’s all FREE! (Credits: mailerlite.com. See source code.)</p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:100px;">Steve is a college graduate, espresso fanatic, and book lover. He wants to open up a coffee shop that caters to people just like him. He decides to call it Book and Beans.
      New customers stop in, order a drink of their choice, and then can browse Steve's wonderful library of self help books and historical non fiction.
      (There just happen to be his two favorite genres.) Business is actually amazing, and Steve can't complain. (Credits: Loysol.com. See source code.)</p>

    <p> Direct Trade stamp means that Caffee has visited the farm, and trade with the farmer takes place without intermediaries.
      There is always direct trade with a strong focus on agriculture being sustainable and long-term. The price of Direct Trade coffee is also higher than the Fairtrade and market price, so that the employees on the farm get paid better.
      Since there is direct trade between farmer and buyer, this also provides long-term, and the employees a financial security. (Credits: espressohouse.com. See source code.)</p>

A Single Origin coffee comes from a specific region. One of the great advantages of Single Origin is that it gives the small farmers an opportunity to get their coffee out on the market without having to produce large volumes.
 By using a coffee cooperative, small farmers together with their coffee parties can reach the market.
  The Single Origin stamp most often appears on coffee from Africa. (Credits: espressohouse.com. See source code.)</p>
