      We roast on demand to make sure that you receive the freshest coffee possible! thank you for your support! We are so excited to begin our re-expansion!

      Who doesn't love a nice warm cup of coffee? We sure do. But, local cafes seem to be popping up everywhere, especially in the larger cities.</p>
      <p>Steve is a college graduate, espresso fanatic, and book lover. He wants to open up a coffee shop that caters to people just like him. He decides to call it Book and Beans.
      New customers stop in, order a drink of their choice, and then can browse Steve's wonderful library of self help books and historical non fiction.
      (There just happen to be his two favorite genres.) Business is actually amazing, and Steve can't complain.</p>

    <p> Direct Trade stamp means that Espresso House has visited the farm, and trade with the farmer takes place without intermediaries. There is always direct trade with a strong focus on agriculture being sustainable and long-term. The price of Direct Trade coffee is also higher than the Fairtrade and market price, so that the employees on the farm get paid better. Since there is direct trade between farmer and buyer, this also provides long-term, and the employees a financial security.</p>

<p>Single Origin
A Single Origin coffee comes from a specific region. One of the great advantages of Single Origin is that it gives the small farmers an opportunity to get their coffee out on the market without having to produce large volumes. By using a coffee cooperative, small farmers together with their coffee parties can reach the market. The Single Origin stamp most often appears on coffee from Africa.</p>
